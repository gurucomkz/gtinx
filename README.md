## Why it is here here?
Project demonstrates our successful attempt to create own CMS back in 2011. 

Project is not very usable because there is no installer here and it lacks of even minimum site template to display.

It just shows what can be done within a month by two devoted programers.

## Back then

According to contract with one government entity we had to use CMS “made In Kazakhstan” but with certain features that 1C:Bitrix has. 
There was no such thing then, so we had to implement it. 
To be honest with ourselves we did never go into core Bitrix code but managed to guess how certain 
things work and implement them by ourselves so there would be no copyright infringement.

Features were:
* Plugin system
* Component system
* MVC framework
* Page constructor
* Backend web interface
* Packages/components bundle to be used by webmasters
* Own WYSIWYG editor with CMS-specific features

## Credits

Core implementation by Sergey Shevchenko and Abzal Ongarbayev (GT SKILLTEX, LLP).

Thanks to 1C:Bitrix team for inspiration.
